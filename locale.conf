% Localization file.
% The localized strings may contain UTF-8 characters, but not UTF-16 or UTF-32.
% The latter must be converted manually from the \U+xxxx format. Note that if
% you use the \ddd repesentation of characters, it must be in DECIMAL format,
% not Octal.
%
% Each line contains a "message = localized string" pair. The message should not
% be localized. Extra spaces around '=' are ignored.
%
% Notes:
%   - Buttons and menu items have a "_" character as a mnemonic (for
%     Alt+character) access. You can put the "_" anywhere applicable in your
%     localized version or eliminate it altogether.
